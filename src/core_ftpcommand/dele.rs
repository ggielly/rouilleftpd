/// Handles the DELE (Delete File) FTP command.
///
/// This function deletes a file on the server within the user's current directory.
/// The function ensures the file is within the allowed chroot area, sanitizes inputs to
/// prevent directory traversal attacks, and sends appropriate responses back to the FTP client.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `writer` - A shared, locked TCP stream for writing responses to the client.
/// * `config` - A shared server configuration.
/// * `session` - A shared, locked session containing the user's current state.
/// * `arg` - The file name to delete.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Result<(), std::io::Error> indicating the success or failure of the operation.
