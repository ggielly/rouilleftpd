/// Handles the RNTO (Rename To) FTP command.

/// This function renames a file or directory on the server.
/// The function ensures the new name is within the allowed chroot area,
/// sanitizes inputs to prevent directory traversal attacks, and sends appropriate

///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `writer` - A shared, locked TCP stream for writing responses to the client.
/// * `config` - A shared server configuration.
/// * `session` - A shared, locked session containing the user's current state.
/// * `arg` - The new name of the file or directory.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Result<(), std::io::Error> indicating the success or failure of the operation.
